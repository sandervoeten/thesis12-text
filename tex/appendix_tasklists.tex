\section{Paper prototype}\label{appendix:tasklists:prototype1}

The user is given some context, i.e., the user knows he/she is using a recommender system to find new music and he/she has a number artists in his/her artist library.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Answer the following questions without interacting with the visualization:
		\begin{enumerate}

			\item What do you think the visualization does?
			\item Which the elements of the user interface, do you think allow interaction?
			\item What do you think will happen when you:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item hover over an node of the graph?
					\item hover over one of the users?
					\item click on an item?
					\item click on a user?
				\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
